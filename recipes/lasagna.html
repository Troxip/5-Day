                One day, not having any gluten-free pasta on hand but lots of zucchini,
                I decided to use 'zoodles' instead of noodles.
                The whole family enjoyed it! I don't use any salt in the recipe
                because the cheeses already contain it. This dish is even better the next day and freezes well too.

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <p><ul>
                    <li>4 zucchini</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups homemade or store-bought tomato sauce</li>
                    <li>⅔ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups bechamel sauce</li>
                    <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
                    <li>¼ cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
                </ul></p>
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <p>
                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
                    <h4>Step 2</h4>
                    <p>Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices with a knife or mandolin.</p>
                    <h4>Step 3</h4>
                    <p>Pour 2 tablespoons tomato sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange zucchini slices in a single layer, slightly overlapping, over tomato sauce.</p>
                    <h4>Step 4</h4>
                    <p>Top with a thin layer of mozzarella, 1/3 of the bechamel (see Editor's Note), 1/3 of remaining tomato sauce, 1/3 of the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, and 1/3 of the basil. Repeat layers, topping with bechamel and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.</p>
                    <h4>Step 5</h4>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Allow to set until remaining liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.</p>
                </p>
